## Game Dev and Design
Concept: Battle Of Condor is a turn based role play game(RPG). The aim of this game is to design a game with a scoring system to give the players a unique experience as they progress through  the game and facing challenges as they fight the different characters who are tagged as the enemies of Condor.

- The Story:

The city of condor has had a long battle with a group of bandits who are are stopping at nothing to take over their city. An intel was received through one of the spies at Condor that the badits are about to invade the city. The Warriors, Guards and the Reapers of Condor must fight the enemies to secure and retain their city.


The game comprises of two scenes. That is the Game Scene which has one player. To navigate through this scene, a player has to use the arrow keyboard keys. The enemies are hiding and the player has to navigate through the Game scene to find them.

The battle Scene is where the action takes place and to dodge attack, we still use arrow keyboard keys and use the space bar to attack the enemies. A message will show up on the screen to inform you of who is attacking who?.

The more the levels you win, the higher the score!.If the enemies defeat all the warriors of condor then the game will be over.
